      <p>"free" + "reality", freality is an experiment.</p>
      <p><b>T</b>he word "reality" often carries a connotation of the hard
        truth.  "Reality" as opposed to ideal.  "Reality" as opposed to
        dreams.  If this dichotomy is accepted, daily life becomes dark
        and burdensome; dreams an escape.</p>

      <p>The word "free" also commonly exists within this perspective.
        If we know of freedom, it is freedom <em>from</em> something,
        freedom <em>from</em> our burdens.  Freedom as the opposite of
        some bad condition.</p>

      <p>But recently (at least within the small part of the world this
        page inhabits), the word "free" has begun to rekindle its positive
        meaning, particularly in the context of the technical culture that
        supports and advocates this global public internet.  Among these
        people, "free" describes more than the absence of burden.  Rather,
        it is more commonly used to describe the opportunity for
        cooperation; the ease and fun of sharing :)</p>

      <p>Freedom, so understood, modifies the perspective of daily life.
        Freedom, as fun, makes reality a wonderful truth.  Not a place to
        escape from in dreams, but a place to live in, awake.</p>

      <p>The word "freality" is a simple little meme, with one purpose.
        To enter the mind and in an easy little thought restore this way
        of thinking.</p>

      <p><b>H</b>ere, you will find experiments in freality.  A library,
        a laboratory, and a small community.  Free music and literature.
        Honest politics and philosophy.  Art.  Science.  And hopefully some thinking about
        our spirit, what makes us human, and where we belong in this
        cosmos.</p>
