  <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050114175659/http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy04/pdf/budget/tables.pdf">The
  United States' Government Budget for 2004</a> (i.e. the amount of
  money to be spent) is approximately $2,229,000,000,000, or $2.2
  Trillion.  This money comes mostly from taxing citizens and
  corporations, and goes mostly towards running the government and
  military, and paying into federal entitlement programs.  $2.2T
  equates to about 20% of the yearly Gross Domestic Product of the
  U.S..  The U.S. GDP is also approximately 20% of the estimated
  yearly GDP of the entire World.  You can compare the U.S. GDP with
  other countries' <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050114175659/http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/rankorder/2001rank.html">here</a>.</p>

  <p>The U.S. Budget comes from two main sources: Receipts from Taxes
  and "dipping into" Social Security.  Receitps for 2004 are estimated
  at $1,922B.  That leaves us $307B short, a.k.a "the deficit", which
  is made up for mainly by the U.S. Treasury selling the debt as
  long-term bonds with interest.</p>

  <p>Where does it all go?  The $2,229,000,000,000 allocated into
  two main categories: Mandatory and Discretionary spending.</p>

  <p>Mandatory spending is used mainly to fund long-term programs, set
  up in advance and by law, such as Social Security and Medicare.
  Mandatory payments for 2004 will total $1,234B.</p>

  <p>Discretionary payments for 2004 total $819B.  These funds are
  allotted as needed every year by 15 Congressional Appropriations
  Committees, and are used to pay for the day-to-day operation of the
  U.S. Federal Government.  More specifically, the U.S. Military
  accounts for about half, or $390B, of discretionary spending (not
  including President Bush's recent request for $87B more for the war
  in Iraq).  Labor, Health and Education, together, get $135B, and the
  rest of the federal programs, including Agriculture, Commerce,
  Diplomacy, Energy, Environment, Housing, Justice, Science, Space and
  Transportation, receive less than $300B combined.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the U.S. Office of Management and Budget finds
  that of the approximately 1,000 federal programs, "In most cases, we
  do not know what we are getting for our money".  They go further by
  providing the beautiful pie-chart shown here.</p>
