      <p>w00t comes to us via a strange path through music and culture. In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060426141856/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993" title="1993">1993</a> two songs with amazingly similar titles both rose to the top 10 of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060426141856/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_magazine" title="Billboard magazine">Billboard</a>'s hot tracks for the year. "Whoomp, there it is," and "Whoot, there it is" by rap groups <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060426141856/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_Team" title="Tag Team">Tag Team</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060426141856/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/95_South" title="95 South">95 South</a>, respectively, were both describing their pleasure at sighting the posterior of a voluptuous woman (and following in the footsteps of the previous summer's #3 smash hit "Baby Got Back" by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060426141856/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Mix-A-Lot" title="Sir Mix-A-Lot">Sir Mix-A-Lot</a>). These phrases quickly showed up on the internet in discussion of the songs and in similar discussion in alt.rap and rec.music.</p>

      <p>However, the phrases were catching on in a larger context....</p>

        &gt;       I taped the Bulls rally today (being from Chicago) and I was trying
        &gt;to figure out what the crowd was chanting.  I still had trouble when the
        &gt;players would start the crowd going also.  It sounded like 'Boom!  There you
        &gt;go.'  Was this some sort of rallying cry they had during the Finals?  I had
        &gt;never heard it until today.

        They were saying (or so the paper says) "Whoot! There it is."  

        I have no idea what this means and I have never heard it in conjunction
        with the Bulls.  Apparently, it has something to do with a rap song
        or some such (implied by the Tribune).  This is not exactly my area
        of expertise. :-)

        I think it would be interested to make a Net.Rogues.Gallery. People
        could send in some of their most famous/infamous PCs and NPCs. What
        does everyone think about it? Does something like this already
        exist? I'd be willing to compile the list.

        Subject: Whoot, there it is/NYT and the death of c-p

        Just finished the NYT article about Idol, which was pretty amusing, but the
        sidebar containing a McHistory of c-p is the death knell, containing such
        pieces of balanced reporting as calling rtm a cyberterrorist, calling the 
        internet DARPANet and saying that EFF was founded to "keep the Government off
        hackers backs." 

        My new "Quadratic Rip-Tide Theory of Information Channels" is that when the
        volume of misinformation about a given subject is &gt;= the square of the  
        volume of real information moving in the opposite direction, the real 
        information is sucked deep into a watery grave. ;-)

        Hey slick,  back up there a second....

        I have that CD-ROM from Burton too, but I didn't see any interviews...
        sure I saw them all riding, they got clips of that, but I never really
        saw any interviews.  Maybe I missed something...

        I talked to some lady at Burton, and she was saying there's all
        kinds of neat stuff on the disk, like clicking in different places or
        such gets neat things not otherwise seen.....anyone find any of these?

      <p>The link to Doom is interesting, as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060426141856/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom" title="Doom">Doom</a> itself appeared in 1993 -- the same year as the popular "whoot" rap song -- and included a multi-player mode where players could type messages to each other during gameplay. The "w00t" form would have been faster to type, and of course more <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060426141856/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet" title="Leet">l33t</a>.</p>
