  <h1>On the Edge Of Reality, Swelling Conciousness</h1>

  <p>Take a mid-day nap.  And perhaps the strong drug of waking dream
  may overtake you. Wakeup to the sounds of something - your cat, your
  loved one - and you may be surprised to hear them before they make
  their sound.</p>

  <p>A neural eruption is triggered in your aural processing and stray
  signals leak out to your cortex.  Busy in its momentary dance with a
  thousand regions only ever named by doctors of disection in their
  peculiar Latin morphology, your dream is interrupted to invent
  something... anything... to describe this ambiguous sensory
  impression, which questions the verity of causality itself.</p>

  <p>Robbed of a complete experience, and confused by the heavy drug
  of afternoon slumber, the on-shift logicians in the left hemisphere
  of your brain tell you it's time to wakeup.  &quot;Wakeup
  baby&quot;.  They swear <em>they</em> heard it.  But they've lied
  before.  I know <em>I</em> heard it, but had anything really yet
  been spoken?</p>

  <p>And then there it was again.  The only utterance that could be
  agreed upon by a third-party observer; certainly the only one heard
  by our cats:</p>

  <p>&quot;Wakeup baby,&quot; she said.</p>

  <p>Only later, on reflection, does our fabulously ornate latice of
  protein and salt begin to yield its secrets.  Famously evasive of
  complete definition, it is still our own brain, still our own mind
  and still scrutible to itself.</p>

  <p>Or at least so thinks the brain behind this essay.</p>
