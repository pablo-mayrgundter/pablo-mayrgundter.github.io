  <h1>A (fledgling) Plan for p2p Search</h1>
  <p>I know p2p search is hopeless [searchenginewatch.com], but here's
  some ideas on how to do it anyways. I'll phrase it like an inductive
  proof: first make a node, then add a neighbor.</p>

  <p>NODE - I'd use Lucene [apache.org]. Lucene is a traditional
  keyword search engine that is fast, lean, free and open. It's
  carried under the Apache Jakarta project, so it's not going
  anywhere. And, it's easy to develop with. Alternatively, any good
  search will do... you could probably bang something together with
  GNU shell utils.  You would need a spider of some sort to grab
  internet content and store it locally.  Again, a GNU tool like wget
  would do.  Perhaps it would spider N-deep from what you browse, so
  it would perhaps have ready responses for many of your queries.</p>

  <p>NEIGHBOR - Turn search into a common TCP/IP protocol, a la SMTP,
  FTP, etc.. Telnet to port 53268 (the digits that most look like
  "SEARCH", leaving one out, to make it in the legal range of
  1-65536), and have something like this:</p>

  <blockquote>
  client: QRY p2p search efforts<br>
  server: HITS 1023<br>
  client: RETR 0<br>
  server: HIT http://searchenginewatch.com/sereport/article.php/2163581<br>
  ...
  </blockquote>

  <p>If there are no results at that node, the server forwards you
  on:</p>

  <blockquote>
  client: QRY p2p search efforts<br>
  server: FWD 255.168.1.303
  </blockquote>

  <p>So, you'd start by querying your own host's search-engine.  It
  may already have a number of hits, in which case you don't even use
  the network for searching at all!  But your own node may not have
  the answer for you, so you forward on to the next. How does the
  forwarding table get setup?  One way to do it would be by hand, but
  also, I imagine posting "known expert" lists to gnutella could help
  automate the process. A list would be a map of keywords to
  IPs. These lists wouldn't need to be too robust, as they'd serve to
  occasionally seed the network, not constantly sustain it.</p>

  <p>Once you had a good forwarding table on your node, you'd have
  access to quite a large search DB. With 100 nodes in the search
  network, each using 1GB for its index, and 3:10 index to indexed
  ratio, that's 100*1GB*3.3=330GB of indexed text. Let's say the
  average webpage is 100KB (?), that's a total search DB size of 3.4M
  pages. Increase the number of nodes to 10,000 and increase each
  node's index size to 10GB, and you have 3,460,300,800 pages, which
  is just about equal to Google, which is currently at
  3,307,998,701. 10k nodes happens to be about what distributed.net is
  running right now, and 10GB is getting cheaper by the minute. ;)</p>
