  <h1>Citizens of the World</h1>

  <p>The United States of America are the world's oldest republic.  We
  have a form of government that has proven remarkably stable.  Though
  we were not formed as a democracy, we struggled to become one, and
  so became an example for other countries in their own changes
  towards democracy.  That flame, kindled long ago, now burns more
  brightly than in any age.  We now live in a time when most people of
  the world have heard of democracy or are actively changing to or
  engaged in it.</p>

  <p>However, there are still significant challenges to democracy,
  both within this country, and among all countries.  Though our
  nation has aged greatly, with respect to Democracy, it has not aged
  gracefully.  In our advancing age, the firm attachment to our
  covetted idea of Nation is clouding vision of our founding
  principle.  Consider these words:</p>

  <p><blockquote>&quot;We the people of the United States, in Order to
  form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic
  Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general
  Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our
  Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United
  States of America.&quot;</blockquote></p>

  <p>Why not change &quot;United States of America&quot; to
  &quot;World&quot; instead?</p>

  <p>Or in these words:</p>

  <p><blockquote>&quot;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that
  all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator
  with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty,
  and the pursuit of Happiness.  That to secure these rights,
  Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers
  from the consent of the governed&quot;</blockquote></p>

  <p>Strange that we have decided &quot;Men&quot; means
  &quot;Humans&quot;, but that we have yet to actually uphold these
  words.</p>

  <p>For certainly we don't mean it when instead of recognizing the
  natural rights of &quot;all&quot; humans, we instead name some
  &quot;foreigners&quot; and, in the name of our Nation, do to them
  what we would never do to our neighbor.  That is not principle; that
  is selfishness.  Selfishness because we deny humanity to others and
  yet keep it for ourselves.  Such selfishness is a burden that
  subjugates our principle of Democracy.  It is a deal with the Devil
  that will undo us if we do not undo it.</p>

  <p>What is a Nation, anyways, that we would forget our founding
  Principle?  A Nation is a group of people that sees themselves as
  sovereign or independent of other people, other nations.  Perhaps
  this reality once made sense, as even life within a nation was often
  too uncertain to look beyond the &quot;national horizon&quot;.  But
  that is old thinking indeed.</p>

  <p>On a globe there is only one horizon.</p>

  <p>And on this globe, a shared culture is developing.  As with any
  development, there are growing pains.  Questions of relationships.  Of
  primacy.  Of control.  Who is going to control the world of
  tomorrow?  Under what flag will our children live?</p>

  <p>Will it be the flag of a single nation?  A group of people who considers
  themselves independent from all the rest, while of course being more
  connected to them than a hand is to a wrist?</p>

  <p>Will it be a groups of nations?  Collected togther under the
  auspices of avoiding international warfare, of managing global
  destruction?</p>

  <p>Those are real opportunities, yes; but those globalist
  perspectives were forged without a shared, popular constitution, and
  so are fundamentally flawed and increasingly outmoded.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, a clear alternative presents itself.</p>

  <p>We should complete the democratic union among humans.  We should
  affirm a new global constitution, and all become citizens of the
  world.  Let us live in a community of all the peoples, a gathering
  of equals, and forge a common direction together.  It can begin as
  simply as this:</p>

  <p><blockquote>&quot;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that
  all humans are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator
  with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty,
  and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights,
  Governments are instituted among humans, deriving their just powers
  from the consent of the governed.  And so, We the people of the
  World, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice,
  insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote
  the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to
  ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this
  Constitution for the United Peoples of the
  World...&quot;</blockquote></p>

  <p>Should we accomplish this greater embodyment of humans on Earth,
  we will have reason to celebrate a new stage in our history.  As we
  finish one great chapter, we will begin to write the next, this time
  with a completely new kind of horizon.</p>

  <p>Ad Astra.</p>
