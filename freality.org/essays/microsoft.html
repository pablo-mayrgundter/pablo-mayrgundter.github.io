  <h1>The Microsoft Story</h1>

  <p>In case you haven't <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041225233804/http://www.billparish.com/msftfraudfacts.html">heard</a>,
  Microsoft (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041225233804/http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=MSFT">MSFT</a>) has
  been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041225233804/http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=230106&amp;CFID=1608647&amp;CFTOKEN=8842676">deeply
  unprofitable</a> since 1996, when it began to rely on holes in the
  GAAP accounting standards that allowed it to report historic profits
  in its NASDAQ filings up until this very day, so making it look like
  the hottest business since ACME, Inc..  Large fund managers bought
  into it to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars, making MS at
  its peak (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041225233804/http://www.billparish.com/20030420barronsoped.html">$700B</a>)
  which for comparison made it the largest component of the S&amp;P
  500, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041225233804/http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/rankorder/2001rank.html">the
  equivalent of the 16th largest country</a> or ~1.5% of the GDP of
  Earth.</p>

  <p>Who cares?  The biggest funds involved were pension funds of
  large social programs across the US, e.g. the California Teachers
  Union, who automatically invest in S&amp;P components at rates
  proportional to the components' value.  MS paid for its bottom line
  with those peoples' money, so much so that pensioners are majority
  owners of MS today.  Too bad for them that the bottom fell out of MS
  stock and their savings are worthless.  But it did help create <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041225233804/http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/140318_richest19.html">two
  of the richest personal accounts on Earth</a>.</p>

  <p>You could argue that this was all legal and that they won the
  king of the hill prize.  Perhaps.  But is it ethical to block GAAP
  reforms via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041225233804/http://www.portlandtribune.com/archview.cgi?id=9726">corporate
  shills in Congress (e.g. Joe Lieberman)</a> so your huge losses
  won't be exposed?  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041225233804/http://www.alwayson-network.com/comments.php?id=1358_0_7_0_C">Enron
  execs are being hung out to dry</a> for being only slightly on the
  other side of that thin line in the sand.  No, it's likely MS knew
  what it was up to. As Bill Parish, who broke the story, tells:</p>

  <p>"Microsoft's perspective is best reflected by Bob Herbold, Chief
  Operating Officer, to whom the CFO reports. Bob very sincerely
  replied, "Bill, everyone is doing it.""</p>
