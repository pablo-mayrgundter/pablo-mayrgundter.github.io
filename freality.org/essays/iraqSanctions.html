  <h1>Iraq Sanctions</h1>

  <img src="iz-political.gif" width="300" style="float: right; padding: 0 0 1em 1em"/>

  <p>In 1990 Iraq took over its small southern neighbor Kuwait, whom
  Iraq claimed was siphoning off Iraqi oil via "diagonal drilling"
  into Iraq's Rumaila oil field.  America, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041225233554/http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/rankorder/2174rank.html">world's
  largest oil consumer</a>, has long been interested in the world's
  largest oil supplies in the Middle East, and so took a particular
  interest in this development.  Although America had supported Iraq
  up until this point (both politically and militarily), some line was
  crossed and America decided that Iraq's (not Kuwait's) actions were
  unacceptable.  Perhaps the Kuwait drilling was a planned pretext for
  this decision, but either way, in response, the U.S. engaged in war
  and economic sanctions against Iraq, with limited approval of the
  U.N. (i.e. the rest of the world).  The war had its desired effect:
  the short battle did cause Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.  (Strangely,
  America did not push on to conquer the country, which appeared
  easily within its grasp, and which it would do a decade later.)</p>

  <p>Iraq had challenged American dominance in a region of critical
  importance to the American economy and to its global power
  relations.  Iraq's southerly neighbor, Saudi Arabia, was a close
  American ally as it held about one-quarter of the proven oil
  supplies on Earth.  Iraq itself was second only to Saudi Arabia and
  its oil fields were far from fully exploited.  These factors, and
  many others, essentially doomed Iraq to complete submission to
  U.S. power when it went astray. [need to tie this paragraph to last
  better.. analyze reason for not conquering in first gulf war.]</p>

  <p>The chosen mechanism of its subjugation, in lieu of war, was
  economic sanctions.  Begun before the war, sanctions were kept in
  place for the better part of the 90s, and in that time brought
  vastly more calamity to, and power over, the country than did the
  war itself.</p>

  <p>We know what happened thanks to UNICEF, who will for this story
  play the role of unbiased third party.  UNICEF keep tabs on how kids
  are doing in all the world's countries, and advises on how to help
  them.  In Iraq, for instance, UNICEF reported that from 1979 and
  earlier to 1989 Iraqis were enjoying a declining infant and
  child-under-5 mortality rate.  Whatever Saddam Hussein was, his
  government apparently improved the health of Iraqi children.  After
  the war, that trend was reversed.</p>

  <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041225233554/http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=40&amp;ItemID=2787">An
  article about the sanctions' effects</a> reports: &quot;In 1990, the
  country was moving quickly into the league of developed nations.
  Universal health care access, free universal education through
  university, a well-developed infrastructure and sophisticated public
  health measures brought a relatively high quality of life to most
  people.  The rate of death for children under five was about 5.6%.
  With the usual rate of improvement, that under-five mortality rate
  should have dropped to about 3% by 2002.&quot;</p>

  <p>UNICEF completed two studies of child health in Iraq during the
  90s, one immediately after the war, and one in 1999.  What they
  found was an awful rise in child mortality: if Iraq had continued
  its trend as of 1990, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041225233554/http://www.fas.org/news/iraq/1999/08/irqu5est.pdf">there would
  have been approximately 500,000 more children under 5 alive in Iraq
  in 1999 than were actually found</a> [the original UNICEF link is
  not available.  The report is fully reproduced <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041225233554/http://www.fas.org/news/iraq/1999/08/990812-unicef.htm">here</a>].
  Even if the trend had flattened, and the war didn't happen and no
  droughts had occurred, the figure for excess deaths comes to around
  450,000 deaths through 2002 (says Columbia University).</p>

  <p>Why had all these children (and surely many others who weren't
  tracked) died?  The majority were from diarrhea and acute
  respiratory infections.  Horribly, this epidemic had been predicted,
  and planned for, by our Department of Defense.</p>

  <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041225233554/http://www.gulflink.osd.mil/declassdocs/dia/19950901/950901_511rept_91.html">This
  Defense Intelligence Agency document</a> demonstrates that U.S. war
  planners decided to target clean water facilities during the war,
  with the expectation that repair of the water system would be
  impossible under sanctions, and that the kind of destruction and
  depravation this entailed would bring Iraq to its knees.  In a
  particularly revealing analysis, the document notes that without
  clean water, epidemics of &quot;such diseases as Cholera, Hepatitis,
  and Typhoid&quot; in Iraq would become probable and that we would
  have to watch out because Iraq would &quot;try convincing the United
  Nations or individual countries to exempt water treatment supplies
  from sanctions for humanitarian reasons&quot;.</p>

  <p>Presiding over this annihilation was George Bush I, and his
  notable accomplice, then Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney.  Later,
  Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright toed the line
  in a remarkable demonstration of bipartisanship.</p>

  <p>Albright even gave us a concise summary of the moral calculus
  involved.  When the U.N. (i.e., the rest of the world) was yelling
  at us to stop the abuse, our media finally came forward with this
  sheepish yelp during a 60 Minutes interview:</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>INTERVIEWER (Leslie Stahl): We have heard that a half million
  children have died (as a result of sanctions against Iraq). I mean,
  that is more children than died in Hiroshima. And, you know, is the
  price worth it?</p>

  <p>MADELEINE ALBRIGHT: I think this is a very hard choice, but the
  price, we think the price is worth it.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Presumably she was doing a cost-benefit analysis here, referring
  to the $8 Trillion worth of oil that lies beneath the sands of
  Iraq.</p>

  <p>In a separate matter, it should now be clear why the U.S. is one
  of the few countries that will not submit to international war
  crimes tribunals.</p>
