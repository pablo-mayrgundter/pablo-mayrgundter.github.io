    &quot;And I say it again tonight...&quot;
  </div>

  <p>America deserves what it gets.  For years we have let the idiocy
  fester.  Now, it is prime time.  The Republicans are indulging in
  patriotic safety fantasies at the RNC that have lost any semblance
  of adult thought, and they're eager to show it off.  From sea to
  shining sea, their speeches ring out to the sincere adulation of
  pundits and couch potatoes alike.</p>

  <p>This mental feebleness is exemplified by Former New York Mayor
  Giuliani.  As he raked the ashes for his own political profits
  tonight, he conjured an image of Bush The Savior so amazing and
  angelic that to question its reality would be to miss the point
  entirely.</p>

  <blockquote>

    <p>&quot;There are times when leadership is the most important.</p>

    <p>On September 11, this city and our nation faced the worst
    attack in our history.</p>

    <p>On that day, we had to confront reality. For me, standing below
    the north tower and looking up and seeing the flames of hell and
    then realizing that I was actually seeing a man -- a human being
    -- jumping from the 101st or 102nd floor drove home to me that we
    were facing something beyond anything we had ever faced
    before.</p>

    <p>We had to concentrate all of our energy, faith and hope to get
    through those first hours and days. And I will always remember
    that moment as we escaped the building we were trapped in at 75
    Barclay Street and realized that things outside might be even
    worse than they were inside the building.</p>

    <p>We did the best we could to communicate a message of calm and
    hope, as we stood on the pavement seeing a massive cloud rushing
    through the cavernous streets of lower Manhattan.</p>

    <p>Our people were so brave in their response.</p>

    <p>At the time, we believed we would be attacked many more times
    that day and in the days that followed. <em>Spontaneously, I
    grabbed the arm of then Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik and said
    to Bernie, 'Thank God George Bush is our President.'</em></p>

    <p><em>And I say it again tonight, 'Thank God George Bush is
    our President.'&quot;</em></p>

  </blockquote>

  <p>This is as tasteless as it gets.  But it's not as stupid as it
  got.</p>

  <p>Giuliani boiled our current foreign policy choices down to
  analogies with Hitler and nuclear annihilation, and asserted that
  Saddam, himself, was the Weapon of Mass Destruction.  And then
  suddenly, pigs flew through the convention center.</p>

  <p>Following this, the nuttiness was confirmed as Giuliani handed
  over the stage to a dead man; a posthumous performance of &quot;New
  York, New York&quot; by Old Blue Eyes to cap the night.  Frankie
  would no doubt be a fan of such a canned spectacle, but somehow,
  that only makes it more surreal.</p>

  <p>Add to this scene throngs of joyed-to-tears conventioneers and a
  battalion of riot-ready police and you have a vivid picture of
  Madison Sqaure Gardens Monday night.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it would all be OK if the world existed inside of a
  rented convention space, and rhetoric could be substituted for
  reality at whim.  But the vision of American destiny the Republicans
  are concocting in the dark corporate TV arena is in dangerous
  synchrony with their warlike terrorist counterparts.  Like the
  protestors outside, most of us look on in disbelief and anger at our
  neighbors gone cuckoo.</p>

  <p>Republicans, you're on warning.  If by some miracle of judicial
  corruption, national blood-lust or just plain hopelessness you enter
  another four years of control, this country will turn into the
  freakshow you've been pining for, purely to spite you.  You had
  better believe your apocalyptic bedtime stories, because we're
  calling your bluff.  You've lost the civil goodwill.  We can only
  ascribe so much to ignorance.  You wanted this.  Well, you're gonna
  get it.</p>
