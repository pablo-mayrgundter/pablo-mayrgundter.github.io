  <h1>&quot;We Support Our Troops!&quot;</h1>
  <span class="float"><img src="/web/20050114180035im_/http://www.freality.org/~pablo/essays/troops.jpg"><br>But, What are we supporting?</span>
  <p>"We Support Our Troops" is the answer to the unspoken, but
  all-important question.  "<i>Do you</i> support our troops?"</p>

  <p>Not that one expects a true answer, but imagine I say "No."  Then
  am I a terrorist? Or perhaps a Red Commie?</p>

  <p>Or imagine I say "Yes." What are our troops doing that I'm
  supporting? Are they engaged in some sort of morally confusing
  situation, that could be right or wrong?</p>

  <p>I think the truth is that such a statement is the kind of guard
  you need in a free society, so that people don't exercise their
  right and capacity for free speech.  As soon as this question is
  heard in debate, free thinking disappears.  You're either with Us or
  against Us.  Do you support our troops?  If not, imagine them
  pointing their guns at you.</p>

  <p>If we were to truly ask this question, as we should, we wouldn't
  sleep well at night.  Do we support our troops?  Well, that begs the
  question: What <i>really</i> are they doing?  Are they defending us
  from attack?  If so, then yes, it is clear that we should support
  them, and join them if the time comes.  But, what if it is the other
  way around?  What if they're attacking others, in offense?  Do we
  support our troops murdering people?  As one of the millions who
  underwrite their actions, I can definitely answer that: No.</p>

  <p>I think the truth is that our troops were murdering Iraqis
  recently, and we assuaged our collective conscience by asking a
  rhetorical question instead of a pertinent one.  I call it murder
  because it was certainly killing, and I didn't see any Iraqis
  heading over here with guns blazing. Since it was not defense, it
  was murder.</p>

  <p>Of course, we weren't supposed to be unprepared when it came to
  the secret contemplation on what our troops were doing.  For most
  people, the rampant rallying around the flag did the trick.  They
  toed the official party-line: the world is a complex and dangerous
  place, that our country has "interests" and that they're protected
  by our government.  Our government is the highest authority.  The
  buck stops there, and when a decision is made, it's right.  Once our
  troops are in the field, moral questions are moot.  To contemplate
  such questions - no matter the result - is to actually be
  un-American.  And being American is the most important thing.  As
  our government is the highest authority, our citizenship is our most
  important essence.</p>

  <p>For the more conscientious, the President's administration
  proposed that what otherwise appeared to be naked aggression was
  actually pre-emptive defense, and deployed a cloud of thin arguments
  in support.  It is now apparent that the rhetorical level of
  validity they had to achieve was that there was a remote possibility
  of truth.  In this, the administration savagely played on the
  deepest fears of a post 9/11 America: any doubt was mortal doubt.
  Not that this excuses our response.</p>

  <p>With 20/20 hindsight, our conscience is writhing.  As the zeal of
  patriotism wears off, we know that our government is not the highest
  authority.  That above authority, which can be corrupted, there are
  principles, which cannot.  We know the responsibility for these
  actions ultimately rests on we, the people.  Perhaps most culpable
  are those that voted this regime into power; in democracy, those who
  carry the vote carry the greatest responsibility.  But the rest of
  us still payed for the bullets.</p>

  <p>One-tenth of our collective tax dollar funds the largest coercive
  instrument on Earth, and it is being used against the loudest
  protests in world history.  When a cry for peace is raised the world
  over, it should not fall flat in this land of the free and the
  brave.  It is clear that we should settle peacefully with our
  neighbors, mad regime or not.</p>

  <p>As the old saying goes: fool me once, shame on you; fool me
  twice, shame on me.  We will all see the outcome of this war.  If
  our leaders fail to demonstrate the validity of their reasons for
  war, we should not trust them to invoke such action again.  Our
  system of government provides us with mechanisms - both swift and by
  due course - to change our rulers, and we can at least hope for more
  prudence in the next batch.  But should this not happen, or should
  this same administration stoke the fires of war again, to send our
  troops into the lands of the weak, to steal resources or advantage
  for our pecuniary benefit, but against our common expectation for
  decent humanity, our protests must be more serious.  These protests
  can start where the last left off: at our Capitol buildings where
  the decision can hopefully be swayed.  But if it cannot, the
  protests should carry much farther... all the way to the naval yards
  and the airstrips from whence our troops depart.  With the cynical
  motives of their commanders laid bare, the soldiers will be headed
  towards a certain situation, and if they do not refrain from the
  engagement, the troops will become warriors of aggression, forging a
  course of their own choosing, and we can turn the phrase on its
  head: "We Do Not Support Those Troops, They Are Not Ours After
  All!"</p>
