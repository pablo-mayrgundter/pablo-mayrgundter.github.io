  <h1>Calling a Spade a Spade: American Fascism</h1>

  <p>It's time to call a spade a spade.  Our government is broken, and
  nobody cares.  We're moving further away from the strong Republic we
  once were, towards a future of warfare and fear.  Our shared pain
  and loss from 9/11 are being exploited for private gain in the worst
  turn of American political depredation in memory.</p>

  <p>The Presidential Administration has run the gamut, and succeeded.
  Congress is mute, the Supreme Court irrelevant, and the press
  adrift.  Most Americans are even confused about who "the enemy" is.</p>

  <p>Worst of all, this is all going according to plan.  A group
  called Project for a New American Century has taken control of the
  country in a quest for American World Empire, and for the moment,
  we're just along for the ride.</p>

  <p>Sound crazy?  Nah, this story writes itself.</p>

  <p>First off, politics is a complex subject.  West Wing it is not.
  Humans have struggled with it for millenia, and it's not getting any
  easier.  We have hopes and dreams, but too often they are dashed.
  They're dashed daily in the Capitol.  At least, one can think of
  politics as a competition for power.  Consider this insightful
  definition by Ambrose Bierce:</p>

  <blockquote>politics, n.: A strife of interests masquerading as a
  contest of principles. The conduct of public affairs for private
  advantage.<br></blockquote>

  <p>This characterization of politics isn't limited to satire, as in
  Bierce's case.  Noam Chomsky has made a long career of researching
  accurate models of political function, and basically comes to the
  same conclusion in his definition of politics:</p>

  <blockqoute>"publicizing risk and privatizing profit"</blockquote>

  <p>Perhaps this is too cynical, but our history is full of examples
  of governments misleading their own people, so why not here and
  now?</p>

  <p>Keep that in mind when you now consider what it is that the
  people of America have come to see this war represent.  As I said
  above, many American's don't even know who our enemies are.  From <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041223152937/http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2003/02/06/iraq_poll/">an
  article</a> at Salon.com:</p>

  <blockquote>

    <p>'At the end of the first week of January, the Princeton Survey
    Research Associates polled more than 1,200 Americans on behalf of
    the Knight Ridder newspaper chain. They asked a very simple
    question: "To the best of your knowledge, how many of the
    September 11 hijackers were Iraqi citizens?"</p>

    <p>Of those surveyed, only 17 percent knew the correct answer:
    that none of the hijackers were Iraqi. Forty-four percent of
    Americans believe that most or some of the hijackers were Iraqi;
    another 6 percent believe that one of the hijackers was a citizen
    of that most notorious node in the axis of evil. That leaves 33
    percent who did not know enough to offer an answer.</p>

    <p>the suspected [actual] national identities of the hijackers --
    15 Saudis, one Egyptian, one Lebanese, and two from the United
    Arab Emirates'</p>

  </blockquote>

  <p>And then consider the private interests. A group called PNAC is
  running the show.  Here's their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041223152937/http://www.newamericancentury.org/statementofprinciples.htm">Statement
  of Principles</a>.  The signatories make up the backbone of Bush's
  cabniet.  This is how they see the world:</p>

  <blockquote>"As the 20th century draws to a close, the United States
  stands as the world's preeminent power.... Does the United States
  have the resolve to shape a new century favorable to American
  principles and interests?"</blockquote>

  <p>We now know their answer is yes, so the next question is, what is
  their specific interest in Iraq?  It's surely not weapons, as we can
  barely find them in Iraq, while we've got a neighbor to the west
  that is absolutely shoving their nuclear manufacture and
  distribution capability in our noses.  Not to mention that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041223152937/http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/bioter/iraqgermsusfrance.html">we
  gave Saddam the best of what he's got</a>.</p>

  <p>No, the interest is their oil.  Direct profits and market
  control.  It's so obvious it's laughable.  Iraq's oil supply is the
  second largest on earth, at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041223152937/http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/iraq.html">$8,000,000,000,000</a>.
  PNAC, specifically Dick Cheney (former CEO of Halliburton, the
  largest oil services company in the world) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041223152937/http://economist.com/business/displayStory.cfm?story_id=1649479">is
  about to get control of it</a>.  And they're <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041223152937/http://www.capitaleye.org/inside.asp?ID=69">well underway in
  planning how to split it up</a>.</p>

  <p>But roll back a couple of years, when this wasn't certain yet.
  Imagine that you're PNAC, planning American Empire through the
  desperate years of the Clinton Administration, and then.. score! You
  find this guy.  From <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041223152937/http://www.progressive.org/feb03/comm0203.html">The
  Progressive, "Bush's Messiah Complex"</a>, Bob Woodward
  speeking:</p>

  <blockquote>This is way too much power to give to anyone, and George
  W. Bush has the arrogance that comes with such power. "I do not need
  to explain why I say things," he told Woodward. "That's the
  interesting thing about being the President. Maybe somebody needs to
  explain to me why they say something, but I don't feel like I owe
  anybody an explanation."</blockquote>

  <p>The perfect fit!  Arrogance must have been qualification #1 for
  the PNAC position.  So arrogant that his response to the largest
  pre-war domestic peace protests in American history was "I
  respectfully disagree", before comparing them to an advertising
  focus group.

  <p>Indeed, Bush continued this contempt for public sanction in his
  "48-hour" speech:</p>

  <blockquote><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041223152937/http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2003/03/20030317-7.html">"This
  is not a question of authority, it is a question of
  will."</a></blockquote>

  <p>This is where we get to fascism.  In weilding power, it is the
  invocation of will, over legitimacy, that is the first sign of
  malignancy.</p>

  <blockquote>"If freedom is short of weapons, we must compensate with willpower."<br>
  -- Adolf Hitler, Landsberg, 5 November 1925 (&lt;-- 1925 was before he killed everyone.)</blockquote>

  <p>Alan Bloom makes this point best, in his book <i>The Closing of
  the American Mind</i>, when he tells of the lineage from Nietzsche
  's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041223152937/http://www.uta.edu/english/apt/fritz/awill_to_power.html">Will
  To Power</a>, to Hitler's <i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041223152937/http://www.hitler.org/writings/Mein_Kampf/">Struggle</a></i>
  for Power, to America's final import of these same ideas during the
  last century's nihilist cultural revolution.</p>

  <p>The real threat to America today is that our post-9/11 xenophobia
  is being abused, just like Weimar Germany's ingrained xenophobia
  was.  Though the initial movtives are different -- Hitler's was
  national identity, PNAC's is national opulence -- the end result is
  one of the oldest stories in history: power corrupts, and in the
  quest for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041223152937/http://www.accessatlanta.com/ajc/opinion/0902/29bookman.html">Pax
  Americana</a>, our leaders are tempting total corruption.</p>

  <p>So, the Ambroce Pierce definition is right on, it's politics.
  But not politics as usual for the US.  The form of politics which
  makes us great, Republic, is no longer how our government is
  functioning.  There are checks to power in the Constitution, but
  they lay dormant. The Congress should have vigorously debated and
  then if need be declared this war, but instead they are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041223152937/http://byrd.senate.gov/byrd_newsroom/byrd_news_feb/news_2003_february/news_2003_february_9.html">"silent
  -- ominously, dreadfully silent"</a>, says Robert Byrd, the
  longest-serving senator.</p>

  <p>Without the restraints of the Constitution, we're left with a
  single, arrogant, most powerful ruler.  I hate to say it, but
  there's a word for this.</p>

  <p>fascism, n.: A system of government marked by centralization of
  authority under a dictator, stringent socioeconomic controls,
  suppression of the opposition through terror and censorship, and
  typically a policy of belligerent nationalism and racism.</p>
