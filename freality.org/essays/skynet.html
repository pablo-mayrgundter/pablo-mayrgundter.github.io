  <h1>HOWTO: Skynet and Terminators</h1>

  <p>In the interest of National Security, it's time to hand our
  defense over to a massive automated defense system and automated
  soldiers.  Thank goodness they are no longer just a dream.  The
  plan:</p>

  <table width="95%" align="center" bgcolor="#efefef">

      <th colspan="2">Hardware</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top">
        <p>'The functions of Honda's humanoid robot are defined as
        follows: An operational system that autonomously performs
        typical operations under known circumstances. If an
        extraordinary operation is required under unknown
        circumstances, the robot will be supported by an
        operator... [The P3, 1,600mm in height and 130kg in weight,
        features a computer unit, motor-drive system, battery and
        wireless apparatus inside the body section. This more
        sophisticated robot can achieve freer movement, go up and down
        stairs and push a vehicle.]</p>

	<p>[Future Development will focus on]:
	  <ol>
	    <li>Further dimensional and weight reduction.</li>
	    <li>Improved dynamic performance.</li>
	    <li>Improved operability.</li>
	  </ol>

	For items 2 and 3, it is extremely important that through the
	evolution of hardware we achieve physical autonomy by
	improving dynamic performance and adaptability to wider
	variations of working conditions. Also important is the
	pursuit of studies in artificial intelligence systems, which
	will provide the solution for improved autonomy.'</p>

      <p>'The Cyc product family is powered by an immense
      multi-contextual knowledge base and an efficient inference
      engine. The knowledge base is built upon a core of over
      1,000,000 hand-entered assertions (or "rules") designed to
      capture a large portion of what we normally consider consensus
      knowledge about the world. For example, Cyc knows that trees are
      usually outdoors, that once people die they stop buying things,
      and that glasses of liquid should be carried rightside-up.'<br>
