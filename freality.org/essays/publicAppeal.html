      <h1>Public Appeal</h1>
      <img alt="[Money is Good]" src="corporations.jpg" align="right" border="0"/>

      <p>We must make the World Public.  The time of Nations, and
        Corporations, and Private control of Public Power must come to a
        close.  "Government" must no longer be a foundation for
        separation of the people of the World, or subjugation of one
        people by another, or war and massacare between peoples, or hate
        and intollerance of different ways of living.  "Government" must
        become internalized in each of us, so that no central power is
        needed or can become corrupt.  This will be the hardest but most
        rewarding challenge of humanity.  When one of us falls out of
        this state, our community must not give sanction to their
        actions, but at the same time must help them to rebuild their
        dignity so that they may again rule their self.</p>

      <p>We must make the World Free.  Those things which do not need
        to cost should not be charged for.  We must replace "cost" with
        "gift", "works" with "creations".  In the same way that Linux
        can replace Microsoft Windows, other free things must replace,
        and then surpass, costly things.  This seems to be completely
        possible in the world of ideas.  And perhaps if we make free our
        ideas, then we will even have made significant progress at
        making our ways of physical living free as well.</p>

      <p>We must make the World Open.  When we create ideas, be it
        software, music, literature, scientific research, we must give
        them to each other free and in full: not only the final product
        of the ideas, but as much of their process as possible.  This
        ensures that others have a fertile source to extend those
        ideas.</p>

      <p>We must make the World Equitable.  When a great achievment is
        made it must finally be measured by how many its fruit is shared
        with.  Our ideas are infinite, and should not be horded.  The
        finite resources of our physical world require a true science of
        economics, one with the factual certainty of mathematics or
        physics.  Upon this understanding of economics, we will
        distribute our physical resources according to our best sense of
        a Free, Open, Equitable Public.</p>

              style="margin: 0 1em 1em 0"/><a href="visions.html">And finally,
          as we work towards these things we must write a new Book.  The
          Book must be written for us and our descendants as a guide
          through life.  It must present the totality of our world-view,
          synthesized from our various cultural traditions.  This book
          must form the hub of our World Public, and must be the root of
          the new wisdom tradition that we will live as we voyage to the
          stars.</a></p>
