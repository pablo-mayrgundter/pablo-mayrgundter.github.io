  <h1>The Future of the Web</h1>

  <h2>Step 1: Location Virtualization</h2>

  <p>The parts are there, they just need to be combined.</p>

  <p>Someone will write a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041224234121/http://bitconjurer.org/BitTorrent/">BitTorrent</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041224234121/http://update.mozilla.org/extensions/">extension</a> for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041224234121/http://mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a> that posts the pages you
  visit (a filtered version of your web-browser's cache) onto a
  BT-esque p2p network.  The plugin will also map URLs to BT hash IDs.
  Thus, URLs may be retrieved from the virtual web network.</p>

  <p>When the contents of a URL change, the authentication message for
  the page, e.g. an md5 hash of its content, will change, effectively
  causing a flush of the page as an entity in the BT-based virtualized
  web.  Each original page will need to be authenticateable, but
  there's no other reason to download from the original source.</p>

  <p>The effect of this is that you will typically no longer download
  pages from their original servers.  On average, all resources on the
  virtual web will have the same effective serving bandwidth and
  latency, near peak and near 0 respectively.  Virtual web resources
  will also be naturally, redundantly backed up.</p>

  <p>This is all true so long as the site remains &quot;active&quot;
  within the browsing population.</p>

  <h2>Step 2: Attention Caching</h2>

  <p>Sites that don't stay active will eventually be flushed from the
  network, reachable only from dedicated hosts.  What keeps a site
  active?  Attention.</p>
  
  <p>All you need to host a page is to be connected long enough to
  upload the first copy of the page.  If it's viewed, it goes into
  someone else's cache.  But if it's not, or if it's only copied a
  couple of times, or infrequently, then it will not make it past the
  critical threshold of <em>being available often enough to preserve
  the illusion of immediate access</em>.  Resources that do maintain
  this illusion can effectively be hosted solely by the virtual
  network.  The resource will then be in - what for all intents and
  purposes is - <em>the conscious attentive memory of the
  web</em>.</p>

  <h2>Step 3: Global Semantic Wiki</h2>

  <p>What is the URL of such a virtual resource?  The host portion of
  a typical URL won't be meaningful in this context, so only the path
  remains.  However, since there is effectively only one host, the
  path must be globablly unique, and deciding a good global path for
  an arbitrary resource is probably not realistic.</p>

  <p>How about as a page in a virtually shared <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041224234121/http://www.wikipedia.org/">wiki</a>?  Each page in a wiki has
  a unique name, and is created as a link from another page.  To
  publish a new resource to the virtual web, you would link to it from
  a page in the virtual wiki.  The first edit of the page would leave
  a copy of your resource (maybe just text, or perhaps a more complex
  resource, like a music file) in your cache, and as long as you
  remain online, links inbound to the new page will resolve correctly.
  If the resource gains attention, it will copy to other caches, and
  as long as the attention threshold is passed, the resource will
  remain globally reachable via the shared wiki.</p>

  <p>The wiki as a whole will be a gigantic semantic web floating in
  cyberspace, with no actual locale, its contents ebbing and flowing
  in and out of existence; a <em>WebMind</em>.</p>
