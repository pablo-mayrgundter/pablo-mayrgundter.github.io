  <h1>Solar Roads</h1>

  <p>The United States has an amazing system of roads.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050114175809/http://www.bts.gov/publications/transportation_indicators/">The
  U.S. Department of Transportation's Bureau of Transportation
  Statistics</a> quotes <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050114175809/http://www.bts.gov/publications/transportation_indicators/december_2002/Transportation_System_Extent_and_Use.html">these
  figures</a>:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>46,675 miles of Interstate highway.</li>
    <li>114,505 miles of other National Highway System roads.</li>
    <li>3,951,098 miles of other roads.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you've ever walked on those roads on a hot, sunny day, you may
  have wondered if it made sense to try to harness that energy.  After
  all, we spend quite a bit of money maintaining and upgrading the
  roads.  What if our roads could be made solar collectors too?  What
  would it cost?  How much enery would it produce?  Is it
  practical?</p>

  <p>Photovoltaics are a very active area of research and new advances
  are being made frequently, yielding higher efficiences, lower cost
  production and more flexible material applications.  Perhaps the
  technology is just over the horizon that makes it feasible to
  combine photovoltaics into the surface materials of roads and so
  reap a huge windfall of free energy.</p>

  <h2>Why Roads? Shared Costs</h2>

  <p>Of course, solar cells are already used to collect solar energy,
  in dedicated farms, on rooftops, or in your calculator.  So why
  bother integrating them with roads?  It's not clear that it is, but
  perhaps sharing construction and maintenance costs between these
  systems could result in a more efficient synthesis than possible in
  the two alone.</p>

  <p>Construction and maintenance are relatively minor costs for small
  solar installations.  At its simplest, a solar cell just needs to be
  laid on the ground and connected to a circuit.  But imagine
  servicing the entire energy consumption of the United States with
  networks of solar cells.  Then, space, infrastructure and
  maintenance become much larger issues.  The idea of solar roads is
  to integrate solar collection into the same networks that are needed
  to support them.  Instead of buying up and converting new land for
  use by a new solar stations in our countryside and building the new
  roads and power lines to reach it, how would a system built into
  existing roads compare?

  <!-- RESUME EDIT HERE -->
  <h2>Solar Cells</h2>

  <p>First, let's take a look around at the state-of-the art in solar
  cells.  Recently, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050114175809/http://global.kyocera.com/news/2004/1203.html">Kyocera of
  Japan has announced a milestone in large-scale solar implementation
  technology</a>.  Their 200-Watt module operates at an average of
  ~15% efficiency, and (extrapolating from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050114175809/http://www.alfenterprises.com/solar/KyoceraSolar.html">Kyocera's
  lower-end cell prices</a> which is basically a line of the form
  price=$5*watts) will cost around $1,000, or $5/Watt.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050114175809/http://www.solarbuzz.com/Moduleprices.htm">Prices across the
  industry agree</a>, but volume pricing goes even lower to around
  $3/Watt.  So let's assume something like the Kyocera 200-Watt module
  will soon go for $3/Watt ($600 per panel) in volume.</p>

  <p>To think about using this as a road material, let's look at the
  surface area this would take up.  A single module is 56x39x1.5&quot;
  and so a surface area of 15.16 Sqft..  Converting to the more useful
  size of an acre, there's 43,560 Sqft./Acre, so an acre would require
  about 2,872 of these modules, would cost 2872*$600 or $1,723,200 and
  generate 574,400 watts.</p>

  <p>Next, how much time would this system be exposed to daylight?
  The most generous estimate is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050114175809/http://encarta.msn.com/media_701500905/Hours_of_Daylight_by_Latitude.html">hours
  of daylight for a given latitude</a>.  But actual peak insolation is
  significantly less, often totalling 5-6 hours.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050114175809/http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/codes_algs/PVWATTS/version1/">This
  calculator</a> produces kWh predictions based on historical sunlight
  data for a selected region.  Based off of its generation report for
  Austin, TX, USA, the following table lists average peak daylight
  hours:</p>

  <table width="35%" align="center">
    <tr><th>Month</th><th>Average Peak Daylight Hours</th></tr>
    <tr><td>1</td>  <td>4.16</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2</td>  <td>4.23</td></tr>
    <tr><td>3</td>  <td>5.13</td></tr>  
    <tr><td>4</td>  <td>4.88</td></tr>  
    <tr><td>5</td>  <td>4.97</td></tr>
    <tr><td>6</td>  <td>5.08</td></tr>  
    <tr><td>7</td>  <td>5.41</td></tr>
    <tr><td>8</td>  <td>5.43</td></tr>
    <tr><td>9</td>  <td>5.01</td></tr>
    <tr><td>10</td> <td>5.10</td></tr>    
    <tr><td>11</td> <td>4.13</td></tr>  
    <tr><td>12</td> <td>3.79</td></tr>
   <tr><td>Year</td><td>57.29</td></tr>
  </table>

  <p>Multiplied by 365 days in the year, that yearly average of
  daylight for this example is 20,910.85 hours.  One acre of the
  200-Watt modules described above would then generate 20,910.85 *
  2,872 = 60055961.20 Watt hours, or 60MWh per year, for an initial
  outlay of $1.7M.</p>

  <p>If the solar modules described above lasted for only 1 year, the
  amortized cost of their generated electricity would be $1.7M/60mWh
  or 2&cent;/Wh, or $2/kWh.  Amortized over 10 years, that drops to
  20&cent;/kWh, which is in line with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050114175809/http://www.solarbuzz.com/SolarIndices.htm">solar price indices
  for industry</a>.</p>

  <h2>Refitting The Roads</h2>

  <p>First, consider that roads are constantly being repaired.  The
  U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics, besides being the most
  ideal conceivable source for this analysis, estimates <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050114175809/http://www.bts.gov/publications/transportation_indicators/december_2002/Economy/html/Public_Expenditures_on_Construction_of_Highways_and_Streets.html">monthly
  maintenance costs for all roads</a> in the country in the
  neighborhood of $55B as of October, 2002.  The pavement itself is
  the major component of that, at 70% of cost, or about $38B/mo..</p>

  <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050114175809/http://ntl.bts.gov/DOCS/pave.html">Another doc on that
  site</a> gives an example road management worksheet from 1985, with
  an estimated cost for the total reconstruction of each square foot
  of road at about $16.</p>

  <p>With those two statistics in mind, let's make a very rough
  estimate of the present national rate of road replacement.</p>

  <p>To be conservative, let's say the costs have doubled since the
  1985 worksheet, to $32/Sqft. for complete road replacement.</p>

  <p>Next, at the above rate we're spending of $38B/mo., the amount of
  road replaced per month in the United States is approximately
  $38B/($32/Sqft.) = 1,187,500,000 Sqft., or assuming roads are 20
  ft. wide, 1.18B/20ft/(5280 ft/mile) = 11,245 miles length of
  road.</p>

  <p>That's the length of road, 0.2% of the total miles of road in
  the country, that is reconstructed each month in the United States.
  If that reconstruction could be transformed into a refitting, we
  would gain significant solar collection power very rapidly.  Let's
  look at that next.</p>


  <h2>Budget and Plan</h2>

  <p>We can now guess a cost for solar roads.  As a lower bound,
  assuming no cost to integrate solar cells into road pavement and
  that the solar road would last as long as regular road, solar
  pavement would cost $32/Sqft. for the pavement and $57/Sqft. for the
  solar cells or $89/Sqft. together, 2.78 times as much regular
  pavement.  There is no firm basis for an upper bound, so let us
  attempt a conservative guess of an order of magnitude higher:
  $890/Sqft.</p>

  <p>We've seen that existing road maintenance is large and costly,
  and that So, let's say the $38B monthly budget for road maintenance
  could be doubled to about $80B/mo..  How much solar road could be
  laid each month?  Of the 11,245 miles of normal road that would be
  laid anyways, you could make 11,245/2.78=4044 miles of it solar.
  That's about the width of the U.S., each month.  In acres, that's
  4044*5280*20/(43560 Sqft./Acre)=9805 Acres.</p>

  <p>Given the above solar generation analysis of 1 acre yielding
  5MWh/month, and a monthly refitting of 9805 Acres, that's 9805 Acres
  * 5MWh/Acre=49025 MWh of power generation added each month, or
  588,300 MWh added each year.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050114175809/http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/usa.html">The DOE says</a>
  that the U.S. generated 3848 Million MWh in 2003.</p>

  <p>So how long does it take to replace the generating capacity of
  the current U.S. system with solar roads?  6,540 years.  Now that
  may sound like a long time, but we should hope to be around that
  long, and the Sun will be shining much longer :)</p>

  <p>Also there are obvious tweaks to be considered that would
  substantially alter this conclusion:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Reinvest saved money from replaced legacy power.</li>
    <li>Parameterize solar cell cost and efficiency.</li>
    <li>Parameterize budget allocation.</li>
  </ul>
