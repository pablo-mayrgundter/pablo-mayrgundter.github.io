<h1>Cato Institute's Pension Recommendations are Unsound</h1>

<p>With the RNC convention approaching soon, and the November elections
not far off, political discussion is turning up in new places.  I was
recently pointed at the Cato Institute by a co-worker, and though I
had some expectations about what I'd find there, I thought Ok, I'm
open-minded. Let's take something off their front page:</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050113131522/http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa-523es.html">&quot;New
Study Addresses Pension Underfunding&quot;</a></p>

<p>As soon as I saw it, I thought, Hmmm.. What do I know about the
Cato institute?  Conservative think tank; free markets;
deregulation.</p>

<p>Pensions.  How will they spin pension underfunding?  My guess:
Since <a href="microsoft.html">pension underfunding was caused by bad
investments in the tech run-up caused by misreporting of earnings via
holes in stock-option accounting</a>, Cato will want to divert the
issue from the obvious solution, accounting reform, and if possible
turn the pension bailouts into a win for whatever private sector
industry is involved, especially if that industry is a large financial
contributor to Cato.</p>

<p>To check this hypothesis, I first confirmed the Cato Institute's
position on the FASB option accounting reform ruling.</p>

<p>Google: cato fasb -&gt; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050113131522/http://www.cato.org/dailys/05-14-04.html">http://www.cato.org/dailys/05-14-04.html</a>
"FASB is Still Wrong about Stock Options".</p>

<p>No surprise there.  But I was surprised that their policiy analysis
basically says the FASB is nuts, when even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050113131522/http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/2003_archives/000668.html">Warren
Buffet conceeds</a> options accounting is a mess.  But I digress.</p>

<p>So, how does Cato craft it's argument?  Like a preacher does for
his choir.</p>

<p>First, they have to acknowledge the real source of the pension
problems ...</p>

<blockquote>&quot;The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the
federal agency that insures private-sector defined-benefit pension
plans, had a surplus of $9.7 billion at the end of 2000 but a deficit
of $11.2 billion at the end of 2003... The reasons for the PBGC's
financial difficulties [are first that] plan sponsors ... invest their
assets in equities rather than fixed-income securities of the same
duration as the liabilities.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>and completely ignore how pensions, typically conservative
investors, might fail so badly as to need $20B of insurance payouts.
Then divert to safer rhetorical ground ...</p>

<blockquote>&quot;First, it should enforce the current premium rules
so that companies do not avoid paying premiums to the PBGC if their
plans are underfunded. Second, it should modify those rules so that
premiums are truly risk based.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>This is the obligatory <em>they should run their books better</em>
critique.  Remember, it's the pensioners' fault, not the scam artists
on Wall Street.  And now for the kill ...</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Finally, Congress should allow pension insurance to
be offered independent of the PBGC in the private sector or through a
selfinsurance pool whose members would be jointly responsible for any
deficits their plans created.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Woohoo!  The crowd goes wild! University of Chicago economists stand
up and cheer!  Nobel's in Economics are handed out!</p>

<p>Instead of identifying the circumstances leading to the fleecing of
pensions during the .com and proposing a fix (which would have the
unfortunate effect of preventing further fleecings, probably by their
clients), Cato advocates &quot;privatizing&quot; pension insurance.
The obvious solution.</p>

<p>It's a magnificent scheme.  Let's review.</p>

<p>1) Let the pensions keep investing in broken companies (again,
probably clients), who can at any time fold and run with their cash
(remember, we're not supposed to patch those accounting leaks),</p>

<p>2) then, anticipating the inevitable further breakdown of the
pensions, pre-empt possible bailouts from the tax pool by shifting
insurance expensive private sources (again, probably from clients).
The relatively small private insurance premium will be enough to keep
the appearance that the pensions are alive and avert major political
attention, but won't be enough to sustain the system.</p>

<p>3) And finally, get rich.  A severely broken pension system can be
bought, pennies on the dollar, and the pension systems *in whole* can
be &quot;bailed out&quot; by the preferred method, private corporate
ownership.</p>

<p>Net result: pensions are available for the people who can afford
them, the rich, and not for the people who need them, the working
poor, who they were designed for in the first place.</p>

<p>Classic laissez-faire.  Publicize risk, privatize profit.</p>

<p>Research for another time: find Cato's friends in Congress who make
this work and write them considerate letters that appeal to their more
humane qualities.</p>

<p>And the political season is just warming up!</p>
