  <h1>Half-baked Ideas</h1>

  <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041224234129/http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/10/27/0418209">I've been
  scooped</a> for the last time.  I'm not one to cry over things like
  this, but it's happening with surprising regularity these days. What
  follows is pathetic wallowing in my own tears. I'm just going to
  blurt out all my ideas so I can do a "see, I said it back then". I
  claim no originality in these ideas, as it's obvious many people
  come up with them independently. In the open-source spirit of
  things, anyone should feel free to use these ideas.</p>

  <p>1) City as canvas. Some of the first talk of digital paper got me
  thinking about it. I figured everything would be covered in DP when
  it became cheap.. sidewalks, streets, buildings, clothes, etc.. Even
  better, these surfaces would be wired up to the net.. finally making
  use of the supposed 1k IP addresses/square foot that IPv6 is
  supposed to give us. For what use? P2P Advertising, of course. Use
  your video-cell phone, visit the GPS-located webpage for the wall
  you're standing next to, micro-pay for 5 minutes of time an hour
  from now, record your marriage proposal over your phone, play it
  back on the wall for QA, and then show up later with your soon to be
  wife.

  <p>2) Star-booths. I live near a park. It's really a lovely
  place.. largely maintained by the neighbors, not city-hall. I'd like
  to give something to it. Well, I've been toying with the idea of
  making a "star booth". Take <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041224234129/http://shatters.net/celestia">Celestia</a>, a laptop computer,
  microphone, some as-yet-non-existent voice-recognition program, a
  digital projector, and some cleverly shaped/coated clear hard
  plastic. Rig it all to be a domed booth.  The computer is closed,
  but running celestia.  Run the video-out to the projector, which
  projects up at plastic dome. The dome serves as umbrella and
  screen. Voice commands are used to control a floating, projected
  cursor. "Left, Right" or "30 degrees declination, ..." until you
  highlight the object you're interested in. "Zoom" and you see Mars
  change from a glimmering star to a full red orb which the wonderful
  Celestia allows you to circle around. Scripts would run when the
  dome was idle, auto-highlighting "interesting" objects, or perhaps
  timely phenomena, with 3D models regularly downloaded from the net
  over the shared wireless in the park.

  <p>3) Massively parallel computing -- hardback edition. At CMU,
  freshmen CS students have a course where you design a CPU on paper
  out of NAND gates. You build up complex circuits a unit at a
  time. The professor starts you off with something like a
  multiplexer, and you get to do the rest.. up to about 4, single
  byte-wide instructions. Neat course. Anyways.. you're looking at the
  circuits, thinking how f'ing beautiful it all is, how simple. Then
  you find out about digital paper. Aha! Why not just print a circuit
  that really works? You could almost start doing gates as letters in
  a font. Just type the damn thing in. I have a fontographer friend,
  and my goal was to blow his mind by showing him a real A-Z font-set
  that was designed in such a way as to actually compute the words you
  typed in it, e.g. "AND" would have leads on the left side of the A,
  and a single output on the right side of the D, and it would
  literally compute the AND function when electrified. NAND, MUX,
  etc. etc. And then just use a page-layout program to make a kind of
  word painting/circuit. Stacks of pages, joined by the spine/bus, all
  working in parallel. The real trick would then be...

  <p>4) Computing as art. Take this a step further by designing a
  font-set/phraseology/circuit that allows you to write poetry that
  actually computes something related to the meaning of the poem. Take
  this a step further and use the phrase-circuit to render graphics
  also related to the meaning of the poem.

  <p>Basically, I thought you'd have a museum installation where you'd
  have a pedestal with a book on it. The book would be most finely
  wrought, goldleaf, gorgeous colorings, leather-bound. And plugged
  into the wall (store the power 'lectrics in the spine). Behind the
  book on the wall, a large digital paper canvas, gorgeously
  framed. But no painting. The book has a fine, lacely thread leading
  to the canvas.

  <p>The museum visitor walks up to the book, and opens the cover. The
  canvas jumps to life. The phrase-circuit on the first page is
  thousands of word-ops long, each word-op giving a clue to what you
  are about to see. Perhaps the page is titled "A Starry Night", and
  the electrified text begins: "The town does not exist except where
  one black-haired tree slips up like a drowned woman into the hot
  sky...".  The image that the page itself describes is then displayed
  on the canvas, the clouds of the starry night swirling, the stars
  shimmering.  Each page turn computing a new poem, a new lavishly
  wrought painting.  A whole museum of art and poetry in a single
  installation.

  <p>Ah, please, somebody make this.
