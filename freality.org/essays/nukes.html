  <p>The first nuclear explosion was done by the U.S. Government at
  Alamogordo, New Mexico in 1945.  That explosion had the explosive
  force of detonating 19,000 tons of TNT, also notated as 19 kilotons
  or 19KT.  At that time, the lead scientists of the project weren't
  sure what the effect of the explosion would be, and there was a
  serious concern that it would lead to a chain reaction in the
  atmosphere and possibly burn off the entire atmosphere of our Earth.
  Thankfully, that was not the case.  However, the beginning of the
  so-called "nuclear age" was no cause for celebration.  On seeing the
  explosion, John Oppenheimer, the chief scientist, quoted the
  following passage from the religious text, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041225234001/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavad_Gita">Bhagavad
  Gita</a>:

  <blockquote>"I am become death, the destroyer of worlds."</blockquote></p>

  <p>The U.S. Government decided to use this new technology on large
  Japanese cities during WWII, by detonating 15KT and 22KT devices
  over Hiroshima and Nagasaki, respectively, later that year.  In
  Hiroshima, 70,000 people died instantly, 200,000 died in total.  In
  Nagasaki, 3 days later, 40,000 people died instantly, 140,000 died
  in total.  After hearing news of the explosion in Hiroshima,
  President Harry Truman remarked that it was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041225234001/http://www.cdi.org/adm/847/transcript.html">"the greatest day
  in history."</a></p>

  <p>Amazingly, larger nuclear devices continued to be developed.
  These devices dwarfed their predecessors, with explosions thousands
  of times larger.  Many explosions were done in the Pacific.  The
  largest explosion in the U.S. program, that we know of, occured in
  1954, in the Marshall Islands, in a project code named "Bravo".
  Bravo exploded with the energy of 15,000,000 tons, or 15MT, of TNT.
  The explosion was over twice what had been thought possible.  The
  plume was 62 miles wide, 40 miles high.  The exclusion zone after
  the test was 850 miles wide, or about 1% of the Earth's surface.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041225234001/http://freality.org/library/video/nuclear
  detonations/Bravo_Fallout_Plume.gif">The fallout cloud</a> reached a
  distance that would, in comparison, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041225234001/http://freality.org/library/video/nuclear
  detonations/Bravo_Fallout_Plume_Superimposed_On_US.gif">cover the
  entire U.S. North-Eastern Seaboard</a>.</p>

  <p>Not content with just destroying Pacific islands, testing was
  expanded to blowing holes in the high levels of Earth's atmosphere.
  In projects Argus (1958) and Starfish (1962), megaton-scale devices
  were exploded in the ionosphere.  They variously disrupted,
  destroyed and created new layers in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041225234001/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Allen_radiation_belt">Van
  Allen Belts</a>, the natural magnetic layers that shield the Earth
  from solar and cosmic radiation.  Those belts have been changed ever
  since.</p>

  <p>The U.S. nuclear power monopoly of ended when the Soviet Union
  exploded a series of kiloton devices in the mid to late 1950s.  In
  fact, the Soviet Union went on to explode the largest known nuclear
  device, at 50,000KT in 1961.  This explosion generated a huge
  shockwave that rounded the Earth three times.  That weapon was
  designed in a project with design goals up to 100,000 -
  150,000KT.</p>

  <p>The bellicose strategy of the U.S. combined with the capable
  response of the Soviet Union led to a situation of "Mutually Assured
  Destruction", a realization that a nuclear war between these two
  nations would be the end of them both, along with the possibility of
  destroying much of the life on Earth.  As this situation guaranteed
  vast military budgets for both nations, they worked the job with
  earnest, developing nuclear arsenals with a force of ~3GT accross
  ~10k warheads each.  At a total of about 6 GigaTons of explosive
  force, we're starting to approach the 75-100GT energy of the
  asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago.</p>

  <p>Slowly, the world public began to realize what was happening, and
  began to protest.  Rather than turning back though, nuclear arms
  development went underground, both politically and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041225234001/http://freality.org/library/video/nuclear
  detonations/3_Craters_Up_Close.jpg">literally</a>.  The main
  U.S. nuclear development program was moved to Nevada, where nearly
  1000 nuclear explosions, that we know of, have happened since.  From
  orbit, that area <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041225234001/http://freality.org/library/video/nuclear
  detonations/1000_Craters_In_Nevada.jpg">now looks like the surface
  of the Moon</a>.</p>

  <p>Even these relatively contained tests brought severe diplomatic
  and domestic protest.  In response, a series of international
  treaties were signed during the end of the 1900s to reduce nuclear
  testing, nuclear stockpiles, and the possibility of nuclear weapons
  spreading to new countries.  Unfortunately, these treaties appear to
  have only stemmed the tide for a moment.  The prognosis for our
  species is again declining.</p>

  <p>At last count, there are 12 countries who are known to have, or
  reasonably suspected of having had, active nuclear weapons programs:
  the U.S. (which has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041225234001/http://www.spacedaily.com/news/icbm-03a.html">recently renewed
  manufacture</a>), Russia, U.K., France, China, India, Pakistan,
  North Korea, South Africa, Israel, Iraq and Iran.  The first 7 of
  these have a currently available capability.</p>

  <p>Additionally, bans on physical testing have become fairly
  useless, as our military has turned to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041225234001/http://www-1.ibm.com/servers/eserver/pseries/news/pressreleases/2000/jun/asci_white.html">
  simulating nuclear explosions on the most powerful computers we
  have</a>.  Simply stated, the U.S. is the main developer and user of
  weapons of mass destruction.</p>

  <p>Ironically (or perhaps obviously), Japan, the only victim of
  atomic warfare, is using what is now the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041225234001/http://www.nec.co.jp/press/en/0203/0801.html">most powerful
  supercomputer in the world</a> for a completely different purpose:
  to simulate the natural processes of the Earth.  It seems they have
  learned this lesson.</p>

  program.</p>
