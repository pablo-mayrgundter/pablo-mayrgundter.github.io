  <h1>An example of your ghost in the system: HUD's HMIS</h1>

  <p>Government databases have been at hot topic of late.  President
  Bush's appointee, John Poindexter, had The Department of Defense
  planning to unite as many governmental databases as possible under a
  single large system, run by his office of Total Information
  Awareness.  That struck a deeply Orwellian chord, and along with
  other problems, got Poindexter booted.  But what really was at
  stake?  It's hard to know what data of ours is available to our
  government.  Recently, though, we got a glimpse.</p>

  <p>The United States' Department of Housing and Urban Development
  recently published its guidelines for a "Homeless Management
  Information System".  Read the source document here: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041225233717/http://www.hud.gov/offices/cpd/homeless/rulesandregs/fr4848-n-01.pdf">"HMIS
  Data and Technical Standards Notice"</a>.  You probably aren't
  homeless, but this database still provides a rare look at the kind
  of general personal information any good government agency likes to
  keep on its citizenry.  Here's a look at what information this
  database would record, how the information would be kept secure, and
  who could access it.</p>

  <p>Here are the information fields to be collected that are
  considered "protected personal information" and thus under special
  security management:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>All geographic subdivisions smaller than a state, including
    street address, city, county, precinct, zip code, and their
    equivalent geocodes.

    <li>All elements of dates (except year) directly related to an
    individual, including birth date, admission date, discharge
    date, and date of death.

    <li>Telephone numbers.
    <li>Social Security numbers.
    <li>Medical record numbers.
    <li>Vehicle identifiers and serial numbers, including license
    plate numbers.
  </ul>
        
  <p>Here's a brief sense of the security checks:</p>
        
  <ul>
    <li>The data is kept on "secure" computers.
    <li>The data is encrypted when transferred across private or public networks.
    <li>Hard copies must be supervised in public areas and secured when in private.
  </ul>
        
  <p>Here's a break-down of who can get access to the personal
  private information with varying levels of consent and knowledge by
  the client.</p>

  <ol>
     <li>With the *consent* of the client, you can basically give the
     data to anyone, but it's specifically enumerated as:
          
     <ul>
       <li>Disclosure to a non-governmental entity.
     </ul>
          
     <li>Without consent, but with written or oral notification to the
     client:
          
     <ul>
       <li>Sharing data between other HMIS-equipped localities.
     </ul>
          
     <li> Without consent, without written or oral notification to the
     client, the data can be shared with these entities or for the
     following reasons:
          
     <ul>
       <li>Administrative purposes.
       <li>Academic institutions.
       <li>Public Health officials, if they can reasonably use the
       information to avert "a serious and imminent threat to the
       health or safety of a person or the public".

       <li>Coroners
       <li>Funeral Directors
       <li>Law enforcement officials by court order as necessary.
       <li>Government authorities that monitor abuse, neglect or
       domestic violence, if the client is reasonably believed to be a
       victim of these.

       <li>National Security entities for intelligence,
       counter-intelligence and other activities as authorized by the
       National Security Act.
       
       <li>Bodyguards of the President and other Heads of State.
     </ul>
  </ol>
