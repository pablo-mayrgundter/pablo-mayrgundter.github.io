  <h1>The Choice is Clear: Copyleft</h1>

  <p>The United States Supreme Court has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041224233747/http://customwire.ap.org/dynamic/stories/S/SCOTUS_COPYRIGHTS?SITE=COFOR&amp;SECTION=HOME">recently
  allowed</a> virtually unlimited copyright to remain the law of
  the land. This is not a surprising decision, but it does finally
  determine the alternative. While Copyright favors decadence,
  Copyleft favors creativity.</p>

  <p>As of today, when a work is Copyrighted we can predict its
  destiny. It will become static and held as a commercial good
  until after generations, it will no longer have any creative
  value. This was agreed to in the case, in the assesment that the
  marginal difference in incentive value of a work was nil in its
  later years. Such a work will not enrich the very public trust
  that helped bring it forth, and to the extent that this practice
  prevails, the public domain will die. Copyright will grow
  stronger in proportion to the vitality of each work it
  consumes.</p>

  <p>As of today, we know the only work that will thrive, that
  will enrich the public trust, is a work that explicitly supports
  the intention of the United States Constitution that Copyright
  is granted "to promote the Progress of Science and useful
  Arts". This goal was ignored in preference of support for the
  particular current mechanism of its enforcement (the the US
  Copyright Code), in a gesture that the Court still believes that
  the Legislature has the public's benefit first and foremost in
  their mind.</a>

  <p>Fortunately, the public can ensure its own benefit. In a kind
  of legal jujitsu, the GNU Project created a way for Authors to
  turn Copyright against itself in support of the Public
  Domain. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041224233747/http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#WhatIsCopyleft">The
  GNU Project FAQ</a> says:</p>

  <p>"Copyleft is a general method..."</p>

  <p>'To copyleft a program, we first state that it is
  copyrighted; then we add distribution terms, which are a legal
  instrument that gives everyone the rights to use, modify, and
  redistribute the program's code or any program derived from it
  but only if the distribution terms are unchanged. Thus, the code
  and the freedoms become legally inseparable.'</p>

  <p>It basically creates a kind of Public Domain that cannot be
  parasited upon. If you take, you must give back.</p>

  <p>By claiming Copyright, and then licensing your works under a
  license in accord with the goal of the Constitution interpreted
  by Copyleft, you will help ensure a wide and deep Public Domain
  for our future.</p>

  <p>Copyleft, as a general method, must now be interpreted and
  practiced in a wide field, incorporating not only programming,
  but all creative disciplines. Copyleft is your opportunity to
  investment in the future plentitude of the Public Domain that
  the relative parasitism of Copyright threatens.</p>

  <p>There are many people involved in this effort already. There
  are programmers (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041224233747/http://www.gnu.org/">GNU</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041224233747/http://www.sf.net/">SourceForge</a>), musicians (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041224233747/http://www.openmusicregistry.org/">OMR</a>) and writers
  who already publish their works under Copyleft licenses such as
  the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041224233747/http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">The GNU
  Public License</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041224233747/http://www.eff.org/IP/Open_licenses/eff_oal.html">Open
  Audio License</a>. These licenses are maintained by civil
  liberties groups, like the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041224233747/http://www.eff.org/">EFF</a>, who provide their
  considerable experience and legal services to create and protect
  practical copylefting schemes. Other groups, such as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041224233747/http://www.creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a>,
  further bolster this effort by providing the archival space and
  scholarship needed to provide a real home for the Public
  Domain.</p>

  <p>Whatever your interest or capacity, the call to action is
  clear. Lawrence Lessig, who spoke on the behalf of the
  Petitioners in the case, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041224233747/http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/lessig/blog/">stated in his
  blog</a> today: "What the Framers of our constitution did is not
  enough. We must do more."</p>
